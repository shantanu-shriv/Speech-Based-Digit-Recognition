# **Speech-Based Digit Recognition Using HMM and LBG Algorithms**

## **Overview**

This project implements a robust digit recognition system using speech processing techniques in C++. 
The system leverages Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for feature extraction and employs the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm for vector quantization. 
The combination of these algorithms enables efficient and accurate recognition of spoken digits from a speech dataset.

## **Features**

- **Speech Signal Processing**: Utilizes Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for extracting features from raw speech signals, capturing the characteristics of the spoken digits.
- **Vector Quantization**: Implements the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm for creating a codebook that optimizes the quantization of feature vectors, enhancing model efficiency.
- **Digit Recognition**: Employs Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the sequential nature of speech and recognize spoken digits with high accuracy.
